Algorithm

I tried to implement the algorithm as explained in the task file. The only change was when assiging weights
Assigned negative weight to the time duration by just making the time duration negative in calculation of weight
Assigned positive weight to HasChildren students and multiply it with 100 to give more advantage to the students having children
Students having matching specil√∂ities were also given positive weights with 100 multiplication
Time duration calculated with alternative addresses as well, if alternative addresses give shorter time, than they were preferred over original address.

PROBLEMS

Problems i faced were many as well
I had to write everything in python, so there was no help from the .ts files i got with the data
I didn't write test for every function i used in the code, reason was the usage of API quotas. If a function was using google API, so i tried to avoid writing a test for it
To be honest i never used travis before, so it was fun to learn new tool during the process
A feedback about the task would be very nice, regardless of the job opportunity :)
